This project is from ITACADEMYSTEP when i was still new to C#.
its simple forum for terminal/console where users can register and login.
it has its own authentication. 
users can see a list of posts.
users can create,update,delete their own posts.
users can create comments on posts update and remove them aswell.
for this porject i use terminal.gui toolkit.
u can also login as admins.
admins can do any crud operations on all comments/posts.

overall it was really fun porjects to make, its not really useful but i learend alot.
